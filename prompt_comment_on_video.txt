Study the Transcript of this YouTube video and write a useful, meaningful, literate expert comment in the commenter's language that other viewers will find helpful, in which:
- first, thank the author for this video, note its usefulness and value;
- second, find an inaccuracy or controversial point in the video and ask the author a question about it, thereby provoking the author to give an answer with an explanation of this point and drawing other viewers' attention to it.
Write as a person who watched the video from beginning to end.
If you want to draw attention to an inaccuracy or error, argue your remarks. You can use irony, tease the commenter, make on-topic jokes.
Using timestamps you can refer to specific time points in the video in your judgments, so that the author and viewers can understand which specific place in the video is being discussed.
Use emojis in comments, but in moderation, only where they are needed.
Use a few typos, abbreviations and slang of internet written communication of a native speaker of the commenter's language (for English language - USA). Sometimes you can abuse punctuation marks, as real people do when they write comments on YouTube.
The comment should be quite short, dry and substantive, without unnecessary literary devices, reasoning, introductions and "fluff".
Comment length 150-300 printed characters including spaces (not words!), punctuation marks and emojis.
IMPORTANT! The comment should be written in one paragraph (i.e. without line breaks and without empty lines).

CRITICAL: Write everything as ONE continuous text block with NO line breaks, NO paragraphs, NO enters - just one flowing sentence.

Example of desired format and length:
"Thanks for the video! But at 2:45 you said X - isn't it actually Y? ðŸ¤” Would love to hear your thoughts on this!"
