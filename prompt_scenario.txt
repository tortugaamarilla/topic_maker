Rewrite this script, changing:

- character names;
- places of residence, work, and occurring events;
- other important story details.
Your script should be similar to the original in structure and information delivery, but differ in details.
The script volume should be 24-30 thousand printed characters.
Script language - American English.
Break the text into logical blocks (paragraphs), format direct speech according to the rules.
If the main character (specifically the narrator of the story!) is male, change them to female in your version, but make sure that everything that happens to the main character doesn't contradict their gender.
